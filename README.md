SnowCone MathFest (SCMF) is a neon-festival math game world built for browser **and** iOS (via Capacitor).  
Arcade modes, story chapters, and kid-friendly mini-games — all wrapped in a shiny **11:16 “phone stage”** vibe.

> If you enjoy the free browser build, buying the iOS app is like tipping the snowcone stand. 🍧  
> It directly supports future games (including the next Apple-exclusive simulator).
