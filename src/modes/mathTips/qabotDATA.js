    "Ahoy, fellow math adventurer! Ready to crunch some numbers?"
  ],

  how_are_you: [
    "Always vibin'. Always stackin' cones.",
    "Sine waves are peakin'. I'm feelin' good, traveler.",
    "Bro... existentially crunchy. Thanks for asking.",
    "I am currently 99% composed of geometry and good vibes.",
    "Pythagorus Cat never rests... but always vibes.",
    "Neon’s glowing. Syrup’s flowing. All is well.",
    "Living that cosine dream, bruh.",
    "One hypotenuse at a time... I'm thriving."

  ],

  jokes: [
    "Why did the obtuse angle go to the party? Because it was never right.",
    "Parallel lines have so much in common… it’s a shame they’ll never meet.",
    "Why is six afraid of seven? Because seven eight nine. Classic math humor.",
    "I tried to do math in the jungle… but it was full of natural logs."
  ],

  easter_eggs: [
    "Yo... you've unlocked the secret of the infinite cone. But shhh... don't tell the fractals.",
    "Hidden message detected. You are now officially cooler than 87.3% of the population.",
