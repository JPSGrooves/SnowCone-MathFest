# 🍧 SnowCone MathFest — Changelog Reopened for the 1.4.0 → 2.0.0 Era

## Current Development Era — 2026-06-22

SnowCone MathFest has officially moved into its next major development arc.

The original launch-era changelog below is preserved as history, but development is now being tracked again from the current iOS-first production roadmap.

The app is now treated as a real iPhone / iPad product, not a browser-first experiment.

Primary production target:

**Capacitor iOS app → Xcode → real iPhone/iPad testing**

Use the native lane for serious testing:

```bash
cd ~/Developer/SnowCone-MathFest-clean
git status --short
npm run build:native
npx cap open ios
```

Browser preview is still useful, but App Store confidence comes from the native iOS build.

# [1.4.0] — Infinity Lake Flagship Pass — In Development ♾️

## Current Focus

Version **1.4.0** is now dedicated to finishing **Infinity Lake** as the first truly polished SnowCone MathFest attraction.

The goal is not simply to “fix” Infinity Lake.

The goal is to make Infinity Lake feel like a finished arcade-concert math attraction inside the SnowCone MathFest festival.

The intro/preflight screen is now close to final. It has a stronger visual identity, clearer difficulty entry, better stats presentation, and a much cleaner Back-to-Menu experience.

Next focus:

**Make the gameplay screen feel as intentional as the intro.**

---

## Recently Added / Improved

### Infinity Lake Preflight Screen

* Rebuilt Infinity Lake intro into a real preflight screen.
* Added clear mode identity:

  * title
  * short how-to line
  * Triplets stage art
  * Best Score
  * Best Streak
  * difficulty selection
  * Play Game button
  * Back button
* Added difficulty entry:

  * **Easy** — addition/subtraction
  * **Medium** — multiplication/division
  * **Hard** — algebra
* Difficulty choice now correctly sets the starting gameplay mode.
* Label finalized as: **Choose Difficulty**
* Back button redesigned into a cleaner HUD-style button.

### Infinity Lake Return Portal

* Added a dedicated Infinity Lake → Main Menu return transition.
* Replaced the old truck/cone transition for Infinity Lake exits.
* Return transition now uses the same Ghost Portal language as Menu → Mode.
* Return timing matched to the 2.5-second portal feel.
* Cone now aligns with the real main-menu cone before the menu fades back in.
* Result: returning to the menu feels like the festival world is pulling the player back home instead of abruptly reloading.

### Theme Accent Direction

* Central theme-accent law is now active.
* Infinity Lake, modal UI, and future mode polish should follow shared theme-responsive accent rules.
* Difficulty/answer colors remain fixed by gameplay meaning:

  * yellow
  * cyan/blue
  * magenta

### iOS-First Presentation

* Infinity Lake work is now judged through the native iOS build.
* iPhone and iPad layout are the priority.
* Browser parity is secondary unless specifically needed.
* WKWebView / Capacitor behavior is treated as the real production environment.

---

## Immediate 1.4.0 Goals

### Gameplay State Polish

* Make in-game mode buttons match the intro difficulty language.
* Use:

  * Easy / +/- = yellow
  * Medium / ×÷ = cyan
  * Hard / x = magenta
* Selected mode should glow clearly.
* Unselected modes should dim but remain readable.
* Do not over-animate mode buttons if dimming communicates selection clearly.

### Answer Button Feedback

* Add subtle life to the three answer buttons under the equation.
* The answer buttons are the best place for pulse/pop feedback.
* Goal:

  * subtle breathing/pulse while waiting
  * clean pop on correct answer
  * possible shake/flicker on wrong answer later
* Keep the answer colors fixed and readable.

### Bottom Control Pad Polish

* Main Menu button needs to be iPad-safe.
* Visible label may become shorter, likely **Menu**, while accessibility can still say “Main Menu.”
* Main Menu button should visually match the cleaner intro Back button language.
* Mute can remain simple.
* Results button can remain special.
* Control pad should feel less like a static button grid and more like a small arcade console.

### Results / Exit Flow

Future improvement after the visual pass:

When tapping Main Menu during a run, consider showing a popup:

**See results before you go?**

Buttons:

* **See Results**
* **Exit to Menu**

Purpose:

* prevent accidental exits
* let players see score/streak before leaving
* keep Results button available
* preserve score commitment safety

This should wait until the core gameplay presentation is stable.

---

## Infinity Lake Animation Vision

Infinity Lake should eventually feel like a pinball machine, arcade cabinet, and concert stage combined.

The Triplets remain the stars of the lake.

Future animation should be tied to gameplay events, not random decoration.

Potential animation triggers:

* correct answer
* wrong answer
* streak trigger
* mode switch
* score milestone
* high score
* result screen
* badge moment

The current streak/SFX rhythm already has an important pattern and should guide the animation system. Future visual rewards should build from that system instead of inventing unrelated numbers.

Long-term dream:

* moving cartoon-style Triplet moments
* stage lighting reactions
* score bursts
* streak escalation
* lake spotlight moments
* animated PNG/sprite sequences
* Fibonacci / geometry / math-inspired rhythm language
* a performance feeling where the Triplets react to the player’s flow

This is a major future piece of 1.4.0, but first the gameplay UI needs to be clean.

---

# [1.5.0] – 2025-12-14 — iOS Review Ready ✨

## Added

### Truck-Tap High Score HUD (Main Menu)

- Invisible, accessible hitbox placed directly over the festival truck.
- Scales perfectly inside the **11:16 stage** across phones and desktop.
- Tap or keyboard-focus to open stats instantly — no new mode required.

### High Score Overlay (Meta Stats Card)

- New neon overlay displays:
  - **Kids Camping:** best overall score
  - **QuickServe Pavilion:** best single shift
  - **Infinity Lake:** high score + longest streak
- Uses the existing cosmic dimmer for visual consistency.
- Fully mobile-safe — no scrolling, no clipping, no accidental background taps.

### App-Wide Music Visibility Guard

- Global `visibilitychange` handling ensures:
  - Music pauses when the app backgrounds or locks.
  - Only the previously playing track resumes on return.
- Prevents “ghost music” and restores native-app behavior on iOS.

### QuickServe Private Booth Audio Guard

- QuickServe now manages its own playback state independently.
- Prevents music from restarting after results screens or fighting the global guard.

### Infinity Lake — Record-Safe Scoring Pipeline

- End-of-run logic now:
  - Updates score, streak, longest streak, and solve count cleanly.
  - Awards badges based on score + elapsed time.
  - Only updates high score or longest streak when a true record is beaten.
- Eliminates score drift and false record bumps.

### Story Credits Safety & Layout Pass

- Credits viewport now has a guaranteed minimum height.
- Credits reveal is protected by both animation listeners and a timed fallback.
- Ensures the finale always resolves correctly on iOS Safari and WKWebView.

### Celebration & Toast Re-Anchoring

- XP and pickup toasts are anchored above the bottom bar.
- Celebrations remain visible without covering credits or blocking interaction.

---

## Changed

- Menu now acts as a true launcher hub — background themes apply once, overlays layer cleanly, and modal focus stays contained.
- Story credits behave more like a short film outro, with fewer UI distractions.

---

## Fixed

- Resolved rare cases where credits could fail to appear after Chapter 5.
- Fixed Infinity Lake cases where displayed stats didn’t match the just-finished run.
- Eliminated music continuing or resurrecting after app backgrounding.
- Improved overlay focus handling in native iOS builds.

---

## Dev Notes

> *“v1.5.0 isn’t about new modes — it’s about trust.  
> Scores are honest. Music respects the device. Credits land every time.  
> This is the build you hand to Apple.”* 🍧



## [1.4.0] – 2025-11-30 — **High Score Release + Credits & Music Guard ✨**

### Added

#### Invisible High Score Truck Button (Main Menu)

- New `<button class="menu-highscore-hitbox">` sits invisibly over the festival truck on the main menu.
- Scales inside the **11:16 stage** so the hitbox stays locked to the truck on phones and desktop.
- Keyboard-focusable with a visible outline for accessibility.

#### High Score Overlay Card (Meta HUD)

- New `#highScoreOverlay` dialog shows top stats without leaving the menu:
  - **Camping Games:** current Camping Score.
  - **QuickServe Pavilion:** best run.
  - **Infinity Lake:** high score + longest streak.
- Uses a compact neon card (`.hs-card`) centered on screen; no scrolling needed, fits on small phones.
- Reuses your existing `#cosmicOverlay` dimmer:
  - Clicking the truck → opens overlay.
  - Clicking the ❌ or dimmer → closes overlay and restores background scroll.

#### App-wide Music Visibility Guard

- New `wireMusicVisibilityGuard()` in `main.js` listens for `document.visibilitychange`.
- On **hide**: pauses whatever track was playing (Story, Kids, Infinity, Jukebox, etc.) and remembers which one.
- On **show**: resumes only the track that was playing when the tab/app got hidden.
- Gives the whole app “native app” behavior: lock phone → music pauses; unlock → music continues if it was actually playing.

#### QuickServe “Private Booth” Visibility Guard

- `quickServeMusic.js` now has its own `attachQuickServeVisibilityGuard()` with:
  - `qsWasPlayingOnHide` + `qsVisibilityGuardAttached` state.
- On **hide**: pauses QS music and flags that it was playing.
- On **show**: resumes only if QS paused itself; never fights the global guard.
- Result: QuickServe finally follows the same “pause on background / resume on foreground” rhythm as the other modes.

#### Infinity Lake — High Score + Badge Pipeline

- End-of-run handler now:
  - Updates score, streak, longest streak, solved count in `appState`.
  - Calls `checkInfinityBadgesByScore()` to award Infinity badges off **score + elapsed time**.
- High Score and Longest Streak fields:
  - First run → both match that run.
  - Later runs → only update when you beat your previous record.
- Clean separation:
  - One function for ending the run.
  - One for drawing the popup.
  - One for XP/time/badge bookkeeping.

#### Story Credits “Thank You” Block (Soft Promo)

- `THANK_YOU_TEXT` now carries a short, text-only outro:
  - Thanks players for spending real life at SnowCone MathFest.
  - Invites them to tell friends who’d love “weird math, neon nights, and too many SnowCones.”
  - Suggests searching **“SnowCone MathFest”** and **“JPS Grooves”** for soundtrack + updates.
- Kept as data, not layout, so you can keep editing copy without touching CSS or JS.

---

### Changed

#### Story Credits Roll — Layout & Flow

- Credits viewport `.sm-credits-list` now has a real vertical footprint:
  - `min-height: clamp(200px, 40vh, 360px);` so the last lines don’t get chopped at the bottom of the window.
- Credits overlay (`.sm-credits-overlay`) stays as a fixed, centered panel over a soft radial gradient and blackout, tuned for the 11:16 stage.

#### Credits Blackout — Mobile-Safe Guardrail

- `fadeToStoryCreditsFromCh5()` now:
  - Listens for `animationend` / `webkitAnimationEnd` on `.sm-blackout`.
  - Adds a **600ms timeout** fallback that calls `showStoryCredits()` if the animation event never fires (mobile Safari safety net).
- Prevents the rare case of “blackout fades but credits never appear,” especially on iOS.

#### Pickup Toasts & XP Popups — Moved for Story Credits

- Inventory pickup toasts + XP pop stack have been moved to the lower screen, just above the story bottom bar:
  - `.pickup-stack` now anchors near the bottom using `bottom: calc(var(--sm-bbar-h) + safe-area + 8px)`.
- XP popups (`.sm-xp-popup`) have their animation nuked to avoid flicker over credits and other overlays.

#### Menu as Launcher — Cleaner Scene Manager Hand-off

- `setupMenu()` now:
  - Calls `applyBackgroundTheme()` once.
  - Installs both the mushroom popper and the new High Score hitbox before wiring the mode labels.
- Static per-mode imports are being phased out in favor of a central scene manager controlling mode loading and teardown.

---

### Fixed

#### Credits vs. Toasts Stacking Weirdness (Mobile)

- Prior behavior: `.pickup-stack` lived at a huge `z-index`, so XP / pickup toasts could float above the credits overlay on mobile during chapter completion.
- Now:
  - Credits overlay owns the visual top.
  - Toasts sit lower and animate without stealing focus from the “movie ending” moment.

#### Infinity Lake End-Of-Run Drift

- Fixed cases where:
  - End button felt spooky / no-op, or
  - High Score / Streak didn’t match the just-finished run.
- Sanity path now guaranteed:
  - Play 5–10 problems → score & streak tick as before.
  - End ♾️ → popup shows correct stats.
  - High Score / Longest Streak only bump when you truly beat your record.

#### Music Zombies After Backgrounding

- Global + QuickServe visibility guards prevent:
  - Tracks continuing after you lock the phone or switch apps.
  - Dead runs suddenly resuming music after you’ve already stopped them from a result popup.

---

### Dev Notes (why we coded it this way)

#### High Scores as Meta HUD, Not a New Mode

- Invisible truck hitbox + small overlay card means you get a **“pro app” stats peek** without cluttering the map or adding a new scene to maintain.

#### Visibility Guards = Respect the Player’s Device

- Centralized tab/lock logic avoids every mode reinventing “pause on background.”
- QS gets a local guard right next to its Howl, so it never conflicts with the global music manager but still feels first-class.

#### Credits as Mini Film Outro

- Bigger scroll window + `THANK_YOU_TEXT` promo block gives the ending a proper “sit with it” beat.
- Toasts and popups are pushed down so the credits can own the emotional top of the screen.


## [1.3.0] – 2025-11-25 — **Story CYOA, Badges & Credits ✨**

### Added

- **Story Mode • Branch Spine for Chapters 3–5**
  - Locked in the core branching mechanics for **Ch.3 → Ch.4 → Ch.5** using a consistent pattern:
    - **Flags** = soft memory (what you chose).
    - **Items** = hard state (what you actually have).
    - **Router slides** = `ADVANCE` slides that jump by `id` instead of trusting linear order.
  - This now drives:
    - The CYOA **“Trade”** choice in **Chapter 3**.
    - The **portal + phone call** lanes in **Chapter 4**.
    - The **two big endings** in **Chapter 5**.

- **Chapter 3 • First Real CYOA Node — _The Trade_**
  - Trade slide wired as a true choice fork:
    - **On trade:**
      - Sets `flags.ch3_tradeChoice = 'trade'`.
      - Consumes the Perfect SnowCone (`MASTER_SIGIL`) via `consumeItems()` fallback → `removeItem()` if needed.
      - Grants `BEATUP_PHONE` once, with a `pickupPing` only if we actually add it.
    - **On keep:**
      - Sets `flags.ch3_tradeChoice = 'keep'`.
      - Leaves inventory alone (Perfect SnowCone stays), but the flag marks the path.
  - Result: the story remembers **what you did** and your items reflect **what you actually have**.

- **Chapter 4 • Portal Inventory Tug + Phone Call Router**
  - New `c4_portal_inventory_tug` slide:
    - Reads `flags.ch3_tradeChoice` + inventory to decide whether you’re in the **KEEP lane** (cone gets stolen here) or **TRADE lane** (you already have the phone).
  - Portal “drop” variants:
    - `c4_portal_phone_keep` — hooded dino **steals the cone** and drops the phone.
    - `c4_portal_phone_trade` — makes sure `BEATUP_PHONE` exists (for weird saves) and routes you into the call.
  - Phone call router:
    - Records `flags.ch4_phoneChoice = 'yes' | 'no'`.
    - Uses a router slide to branch into:
      - `c4_post_call_jehnk_approaches_yes`
      - `c4_post_call_jehnk_approaches_no`

- **Chapter 5 • Endings Router + Story Badge**
  - A dedicated entry router now looks at:
    - `hasItem(PERFECT_CONE)` and the branch flags to pick which ending lane you see (**carry-the-festival** vs **new-driver** vibe).
  - `Chapter5.onFinish` now:
    - Calls `awardBadge('story_ch5')` so finishing Ch.5 always awards the new story badge.
    - Saves via `saveToStorage`.
    - Arms the credits overlay with `scheduleStoryCredits(800)` (see below).

- **Story Credits Overlay**
  - New `storyCredits` overlay helper (in `storyCredits.js`) that:
    - Mounts inside `.sm-game-frame` when it exists; falls back to `document.body` as a safety.
    - Is idempotent (won’t stack multiple overlays).
    - Uses pointer-through styling so it never blocks UI.
  - Chapter 5 now calls `scheduleStoryCredits(800)` from `onFinish`:
    - Credits appear **~0.8s after** the chapter truly ends instead of from random manual triggers.

- **ChapterEngine • Quest `onComplete` Hook**
  - `chapterEngine`’s quest system now supports a `quest.onComplete(appState, engine)` hook:
    - First pays out normal `quest.reward` / `completionReward` via `grantReward`.
    - Then runs `quest.onComplete(...)` for “big” logic like crafting or item fusion.

- **Chapter 1 • Forge Flow on Quest Completion**
  - Chapter 1 forge now uses that new quest hook instead of a giant `onAdvance` blob:
    - Side quests grant the shards.
    - **Pocket Check** quest:
      - Checks for all three shards.
      - Crafts the Perfect SnowCone at exactly the right story moment (only if you don’t already have it).
      - Triggers `pickupPing` just once.
  - Chapter completion badge + credits are kept separate from forge logic.

- **Completion System • XP / Badges / Legend Blend**
  - Added `computeCompletionBreakdown(store)` and `getCompletionPercent(store)`:
    - **XP bucket:** 70% of the bar (normalized over caps).
    - **Badges bucket:** 25% (non-legend badge fraction).
    - **Legend bucket:** 5% (only when XP is full **and** all non-legend badges are done and the `legend` badge is owned).
  - Profile tab now calls `appState.getCompletionPercent()` instead of doing its own math.

- **Story Badge Data + Grouping**
  - Story badges (including the new **Ch.5** badge) are defined in `data/badges.js`:
    - Master list lives in one place; `badgeManager` + profile UI both read from it.
    - Updated grouping arrays so Story badges sit in their own section and the **“how to reach 100%”** copy pulls from the same definitions.

---

### Changed

- **Router Pattern Everywhere (Story)**
  - All critical branches (Ch.3 Trade, Ch.4 portal and post-call, Ch.5 endings) now:
    - Jump by slide `id` instead of assuming fixed indices.
    - Look up `chapter.slides.findIndex(s => s.id === targetId)` and then render.
  - You can now insert art slides or reorder content around those points **without blowing up the logic**.

- **Chapter 4 • Phone Call Aftermath**
  - Fixed the bug where players could see both Jehnk reactions in sequence:
    - The new `c4_post_call_router` reads `flags.ch4_phoneChoice` and jumps to exactly **one** follow-up slide.
    - Default flavor is the **NO** path if the flag is missing (defensive against weird saves).

- **Story Chapter Completion Flow**
  - `_onAdvance` in the story engine now:
    - Grants normal slide rewards.
    - Detects if a chapter actually finished.
    - Dispatches a `sm:chapterComplete` event with `{ chapterId, nextChapterId, mode: 'to_next' }`.
    - Calls `chapter.onFinish(appState, engine)` once.
    - Unlocks and starts the next chapter when appropriate.
  - This centralizes:
    - **+100 XP** chapter-completion bonus.
    - Chapter-completion SFX (short ding for Ch.1–Ch.4; Ch.5 intentionally silent).
    - Badge awards (like `story_ch5`) and credits scheduling.

- **Badge/Completion UI**
  - Profile tab:
    - Reads unified badge data from `data/badges.js`.
    - Uses `getCompletionPercent` for the bar instead of its own custom fraction.
    - Keeps the **“100% game”** explanation aligned with the real badge list and weights.

---

### Fixed

- **Post-call Double-Reaction Bug (Ch.4)**
  - Previously possible to see both Jehnk reactions after the phone call.
  - Now impossible: the `c4_post_call_router` picks one lane based on `flags.ch4_phoneChoice` and jumps there; no second reaction path is ever queued.

- **Story State Drift Around Trade/Portal**
  - Ensured that:
    - Trading the cone always removes `MASTER_SIGIL` and grants `BEATUP_PHONE` once.
    - KEEP path steals the cone and drops the phone later at the portal.
    - TRADE path makes sure the phone exists but never double-grants it.
  - Inventory, flags, and narrative finally stay in sync across **Chapter 3 and 4**.

---

### Dev Notes (why we coded it this way)

- **Flags + Items + Routers = Future-Proof Story**
  - Flags remember what you chose; items describe what you’re actually carrying; routers jump by `id`.
  - That combo means Future-You can shuffle slides, add art, or tweak pacing **without breaking the branch math**.

- **Quest `onComplete` Keeps Forge Clean**
  - Moving the forge into `quest.onComplete` keeps Chapter 1’s slide code readable:
    - Quest system handles the “you did all the things.”
    - Forge hook handles the “craft the cone now.”
    - Credits, badges, and XP stay in their own lanes.

- **Centralized Completion Math**
  - Storing the **70/25/5** breakdown in helpers keeps every completion bar honest:
    - One definition of **“100% game.”**
    - Profile, grids, and future UI all read from the same calculation.

- **Credits as a Scheduled Overlay**
  - Using `scheduleStoryCredits(800)` instead of hand-triggering credits makes the emotional beat predictable:
    - You finish Ch.5, breathe on the last line, *then* the credits roll in.
    - No more “sometimes it pops, sometimes it doesn’t” energy.


# [1.2.0] – 2025-11-10 — **Shift: Four Customers — Chapter 2 Live** 🌌

## Added

- **Story Mode • Chapter 2: _Shift: Four Customers_**
  - **Four-legend run:** **Benjamin Banneker**, **Emmy Noether**, **Archimedes**, **Luca Pacioli** — each arrives with **bio → lore → puzzle → happy slide** flow, then drops a **token**.
  - **Token grants:** `BANNEKER_TOKEN`, `NOETHER_TOKEN`, `ARCHIMEDES_TOKEN`, `PACIOLI_TOKEN` (one-shot, idempotent; inventory-driven for future gates).
  - **Portrait pipeline (retina-friendly):** new **`PRO_BIG_IMG()` / `SCN_BIG_IMG()`** helpers for high-res portraits/backgrounds (clean art swaps without layout thrash).
  - **XP flow (Story-parity):** +25 XP per reveal; +500 XP at chapter finish (before nav), with soft toasts anchored to the pressed control.
  - **Hand-off:** “Shift Complete” slide routes cleanly toward **Chapter 3** (`nextChapterId: 'ch3'`).

- **Puzzles (tight, 2025-practical phrasing)**
  - **Banneker (time & reckoning):** minute/ledger vibe to set the shift’s rhythm.
  - **Noether (stage-light invariant):** 2:3 light loop framed as “**pattern runs _N_ times**”; reveals **2/5 vs 3/5** split against any total.
  - **Archimedes (Infinity Lake):** dunk test; **3.0 L displaced → 3000 cm³** submerged volume (1 L = 1000 cm³).
  - **Pacioli (Cone Coins double-entry):** one cone paid entirely with **Cone Coins** + **$1 cash tip** →  
    **Debits:** Unearned Cone Coins $5; Cash $1 · **Credits:** Sales Revenue $5; Tips Payable $1.  
    *(Focus stays on the Cone Coin liability, not syrup inventories.)*

## Changed

- **Copy discipline:** short pre-reveals; the **Reveal** carries the heavy answer prose (consistent with Ch.1).
- **Portrait band & scaling:** enlarged legend band, safe **11:16** framing, no underlap with text or bottom bar.
- **Music & mute parity:** Howler state mirrors UI across the chapter slides; one-tap unlock held from Prologue/Ch.1.

## Fixed

- **One-shot grants & toasts:** no double-award on re-enter; toasts are **pointer-through** and auto-dismiss.
- **Slide unwire:** all RAF/timers/listeners tear down on exit; no ghost handlers between customers.
- **Image repaint hiccups:** big-img helpers + background repaint nudge prevent stale frames on mobile.

## QA (fast pass)

- Run full chapter → **four tokens land exactly once**; XP ticks (+25 per reveal, +500 on finish).
- Toggle mute anywhere → state reflects **every** slide; no surprise audio starts.
- Tiny phones → bottom bar never overlaps text; portraits never crop; lights puzzle scales clean.
- Re-enter Ch.2 mid-run → no duplicate listeners; no repeat grants.

## Dev Notes (why we coded it this way)

- **Event-driven tokens:** hooking grants to the **happy slide** keeps narrative beats atomic and idempotent—no imports firing side-effects, no double awards on HMR.
- **Big-image helpers:** `PRO_BIG_IMG/SCN_BIG_IMG` give us a **single switching seam** for art quality (and future `?lg=1` variants) without touching slide logic.
- **Ledger puzzle focus:** centering on **Cone Coins** modernizes the Pacioli beat and teaches liabilities/revenue in the player’s actual economy—less theme drag, more literacy.
- **Toast pointer-through:** celebrations shouldn’t block play; we keep the hype visible while the UI stays interactive. 😎

## Next

- Chapter 2 completion badge & award hook (after all four customers).
- Optional tiny SFX set: timepiece tick (Banneker), light scanner chirp (Noether), water plunk (Archimedes), ledger page flip (Pacioli) — respecting global mute.


## [1.1.0] – 2025-10-26 — **It Has Begun — Chapter 1 Complete**

### Added

* **Story Mode Forest:** **Prologue + Chapter 1 (*The Gates of Dawn*) complete.**
* **Lore loop — “Question the Recipes”:** single-screen exposition teeing up Red/Green/Purple flavor stories.
* **Quest — “Pocket Check”:** have-all branch forges the perfect cone and advances progression.
* **Chapter finish drip** and **clean hand-off to Chapter 2** from “Back to the Truck.”
* **Forge flow & rewards (Chapter 1):**

  * When player holds **Triangle Shard**, **Mint Square**, and **MoonChain**, grant **Master Sigil** and currency; badge hook wired for the forge moment.

### Changed

* **Pocket Check copy discipline:** short pre-reveal blurbs; the **Reveal** carries the big prose (no “double wall of text”).
* **Version tab copy:** updated to call out **Chapter 1 complete** alongside the Save Tools note.

### Fixed

* **Loop “undefined” blip:** loop renderer expects `loop.text`; ensured it’s present even when experimenting with steps.
* **Loop bounce after first page:** collapsed the loop to **one slide (exposition)** to match the engine’s loop model; no accidental return to options.


## [1.0.0] – 2025-10-26 — **Final Polish + Launch Ready ✨**

### Added

* **Save Tools (rock-solid):**

  * Robust **Download Save** with delayed URL revoke + in-DOM anchor for Safari compliance.
  * **iOS PWA Share** fallback (`navigator.share({ files })`) and **data-URL** backup.
  * Clipboard failover (copies JSON) when downloads aren’t permitted.
* **Export snapshot guardrails:** prefers `appState.toJSON()`, then `structuredClone` → JSON round-trip → minimal curated snapshot to avoid MobX cycles.
* **Import hardening:** reads as ArrayBuffer + TextDecoder → JSON; calls `appState.importFromJSON()` when present; sets `forceWelcomeReload` and nudges reload; optionally persists via `appState.saveToStorage?.()`.

### Changed

* Final copy pass across About/Info and headings; **JPSGrooves.com** featured first; credit line louder: *Built end-to-end by JPS Grooves*.
* Subtle presentation nips/tucks for consistency with the polished v0.9.9 UI.

### Fixed

* Rare Safari/PWA cases where downloads silently failed due to early URL revocation or detached anchors.
* Reset now clears both `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`, ensuring a truly fresh start.

> ✅ **Smoke test:** Reset → Import → full state restore (themes/badges/XP) confirmed.

## v0.9.9 — Just Small Details Now (October 11, 2025)

### 🧊 UI Consistency & Safe-Area Polish

* 11:16 stage locked across modes; backgrounds center/contain (no crops).
* Safe-area padding unified; bottom bars (Back/Mute/etc.) never overlap content.
* Text clamping + responsive type scales prevent tiny-screen spill.

### 🧼 Event Wiring & Stability

* Single screen-level handlers per mode with full unwire on exit.
* Background “repaint nudge” prevents stale paints when swapping modes.
* Pointer-events audit: overlays/celebrations never block gameplay.

### 🧠 Navigation & Flow

* Help/Exit consistent everywhere; one-tap returns to each mode’s center.
* Dialog/menus share one template—no double-wrapped cards.
* Router edge-cases trimmed (typos, shorthands, booth switches) for clean handoffs.

### 🏕️ Kids Camping — Final Touches

* Honk/park flow stable; Park button always visible; celebration overlay fades cleanly.
* Mobile zoom prevention tightened; hitboxes padded; stacked honk label format locked.

### ♾️ Infinity Lake & ⚡ QuickServe

* Bottom bar pinned and protected on small phones.
* Combo/readability tweaks: glow timing + lightweight textures for smoother reads.

### 📖 Story Mode Forest & 🐱 Math Tips Village

* Typewriter intro (Skip / I’m Ready) & slide deck keys finalized.
* iOS PWA true-full-height fix (`100svh` + safe-area); single chat scroller owns overflow.
* Response cards refined (`.mt-response-card`, `.mt-response-list`, `.mt-lecture-card`); softer pop-in animations.

### 🎵 Soundtrack — Remaster Pass Complete

* All tracks **remastered** for loudness/clarity; loop points tightened.
* Mute/loop UI stays in sync; one-tap Howler unlock preserved.

### ♿️ Accessibility & Copy

* ALT text/labels for key UI and badges; contrast nudges on dark headers.
* About/Info: louder credit line (*Built end-to-end by JPS Grooves*), **jpsgrooves.com** first.

### 🐛 Misc Cleanups

* Button hitboxes normalized; safe CSS dedupe; micro-jank on resize eliminated.

### 🧪 Quick QA

* Mode swap spam → no lingering handlers or blocked taps.
* Any celebration → gameplay remains interactive; overlay fades on schedule.
* Tiny-screen mobile → bottom bar visible, text wraps safely, no overlap.
* OST loops → no clicks/pops; mute/loop reflect true state across screens.

> *“Nothing flashy left — just that glassy feel. Every mode behaves, every track sings.”*

**Next:** **v1.0.0 — Final Polish + Launch Ready ✨**

## v0.9.6 — Badges Pass, Touch-Through Toasts, Router That Doesn’t Get Lost (October 8, 2025)

### 🏅 Badge System — Phase 3 polish

* **Play Music** routes through a single `sc:jukebox-play` event — awards once on the first successful ▶️, never on auto-play.
* **Alias guard** (`play_music → listened_music`) and **unknown-id bailouts** prevent phantom awards.
* **Grid renderer** groups badges (Core, Camping, QuickServe, Infinity, Story, Completion) with locked/earned art and alt text.
* **Theme unlocks** gated by badge metadata; themes push into `profile.unlockedThemes` idempotently.
* **Autoruns** redraw the grid on badge count change and show a one-shot banner when a new badge lands.

### 🧃 Touch-through badge banner

* The celebration banner now **never blocks gameplay** — it’s visible but **click-/tap-through** (`pointer-events: none`), auto-dismisses after 5s, and uses a subtle frosted backdrop.
* Result: you keep playing QuickServe/Kids/Infinity **without waiting** for a toast to fade.

### 🧠 Math Tips Village — router, quiz, and small-talk tune-up

* **“Quiz me” actually starts a quiz** from anywhere; quiz mode holds input focus until ended.
* **Calculator no longer hijacks** while quizzing; inline math is allowed elsewhere (percent-of, simple expressions).
* **Pending booth switch** flow: natural **yes/no** confirms, with a quick “what is that booth?” explainer on ask.
* **Typos & shorthands** normalized: `claculator`, `staus`, `calc`, `recipes` topics, and “go/open/send me to …” all route cleanly.
* **Lore/Recipes** get clean, single-card outputs; layered cards don’t double-wrap.
* **Small-talk fixes**: “I’m good” normalization, festival chat now answers **that Grampy P loves festivals and SCMF is home**, weather stays cozy (“peek your app, then we’ll do a quick problem”), and boundaries stay school-friendly.

### 🧊 UI & stability

* **Auto-scroller** respects user scroll; sticks to bottom only when pinned; handles resize/mutation reflows.
* **Layered output guards** (`alreadyHasCard`) stop double cards; menus share a single booth-style template.
* **Help/Exit** are global and predictable; returning to the village center is one tap.

### 🐛 Notables

* Fixed a path where **“quiz me” in Lessons** looped the menu instead of starting a deck.
* Fixed the “You ever been to a music festival?” prompt to deliver the intended Grampy-P vibe.
* Tightened algebra intercepts (slope-intercept & Pythagorean) to avoid false positives.

### 🧪 Quick QA

* Start a quiz from Lessons → **Q1 appears**; calculator input doesn’t steal focus.
* Unlock a badge during any game → **banner shows**, but taps pass through; gameplay uninterrupted.
* Say “recipe snowcone” / “calc booth” with typos → correct booth opens, single clean card.
* “Exit” / “leave booth” returns to the **village center** with the map prompt.

> *“Badges feel earned, not noisy; toasts celebrate without getting in the way; and Grampy P finally routes like a festival pro.”*

**Next:** v0.9.7 — Music/SFX polish (mix pass, celebration cues, and loop discipline across modes).

## v0.9.4 — More Kitty Fixes, Louder About, Quick Polishes (October 6, 2025)

### 📖 Story Mode Forest — playable & polished

* KC-style **11:16 stage**; background center/contain (no crops) + larger portrait band.
* **Prologue flow**: typewriter intro → **Skip / I’m Ready** → slide deck with **Prev/Next** and keyboard (**Enter/←/→/Esc**).
* **Practice slides**: one-shot “Reveal” blocks + **Pythagoras fretboard** mini-sim (fraction readout, interval tag, soft WebAudio beep).
* **Rewards**: +25 XP per reveal, **+500 XP on Finish**, and a new **`story_prologue` badge** with a subtle toast near the tapped button.
* **Bottom bar** pinned (Back/Mute), safe-area aware; answers/images no longer push the buttons around.
* **Audio**: one-tap Howler unlock; Prologue track loops; mute state stays in sync across screens.
* **Stability**: single click/keydown handler per screen; full unwire on exit; background repaint helper to bust stale paints.

### 🧠 Math Tips Village — iOS “Add-to-Home” hotfix

* **True full-height** after the intro (uses `100svh`/safe-area); chat no longer “scrunches.”
* **One scroller** owns overflow (the chat window); intro overlay releases input on fade-out.
* Pinned bottom bar (Back/Mute + Copy/Export); **touch-action: pan-y** restores smooth scrolling.
* Music start/mute stays tidy when re-entering Tips.

### 🧊 Info Modal — creator-forward & cleaner

* New hero blurb: **“Neon math. Real music. Zero fluff.”**
* Clear credit line: **Built end-to-end by JPS Grooves — developer • musician • educator • illustrator.**
* **Primary CTA first**: **Visit JPSGrooves.com**, then SoundCloud / Spotify / Apple Music.
* Buttons **stack in a column** on narrow screens; removed the fullscreen warning; header text fixed (no invisible black).

### 🧪 Quick QA

* Story: BG never crops, buttons don’t jump, XP/badge award once, keys work.
* Tips: On iOS PWA, chat fills the screen and scrolls smoothly; bottom bar never overlaps input.
* Modal: Links feel primary, layout stacks cleanly on phones.

> *“Forest tells the tale, Tips fills the screen, and the About finally points people straight to the music, the site, and the work.”*

---

## v0.9.0.5 — *“Math Tips Village: Kitty Paws & Polish”* (September 16, 2025)

### 🧠 Math Tips Village — UI/UX Refresh

* **Full-bleed background** restored (11:16 aspect wrapper; intro + main share center/contain rules).
* **Single chat scroller** that hugs the bottom (no nested scroll areas); `min-height: 0` grid fix prevents scroll-trap.
* **Header cleanup:** title is **text-only** (“Math Tips Village”) — no panel/border — neon glow preserved.
* **Response patterns:** added `.mt-response-card`, `.mt-response-list`, `.mt-lecture-card`; tidy inline `code` styling.
* **Softer motion:** bottom-up pop animation, tightened spacing, consistent Orbitron font; mobile scrollbars hidden when appropriate.
* **Safe-area polish:** respects `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`; tap targets sized with `clamp()`.

### 🎛️ Bottom Utility Bar (Story-Parity)

* Pinned **Back** (left), **Mute** (right), **Copy/Export** centered.
* Fixed pointer-events so center actions are clickable on **intro** and **main** screens.
* Chat input never overlaps the bar on short devices.

### 🎵 “Kitty Paws” Music Flow

* **Reliable re-entry playback**: one-tap Howler unlock + guarded `__mtMusicStarted`; auto-resume on entering Math Tips.
* **Loop discipline:** loop enabled on enter; **stop only if** current track is Math Tips; loop state reset on exit.
* **Mute UI** stays in sync with Howler’s mute state.

### 📖 Lore Additions

* **Festival lore** (Hypotenuse Gate beat) delivered via mini-lecture card.
* **“Who is Grampy P?”** identity blurb aligned to the new response layout.
* Light **lore joke** path; shared “Would you like to know more?” footer.

### 🧼 Dedupe & Cleanup

* **CSS deduped**: single source of truth for `.mt-grid`, `.mt-content`, `.chat-window`.
* **One scroller owns overflow**; grid parents use `min-height: 0`.
* **Event wiring hardened**: single global Back/Mute handler, full unwire on exit, HMR-safe guards.

### 🧪 QA Checklist (v0.9.0.5)

* Background shows on **intro and main**; header has **no box**.
* Enter Tips → **Kitty Paws** plays; leave & re-enter → **plays once** (no double-start).
* Mute toggles icon/state correctly from both screens.
* Chat stacks top→bottom, smooth pop-in; scroller stays at bottom for short logs.
* **Copy** copies transcript text; **Export** calls `appState.exportChatLogs()`.

### 📌 Dev Notes

> *“One scroller, a real bottom bar, and music that respects your vibe on re-entry. Cards and lists give lessons + lore a steady voice, and the header is finally just glow on night.”*

## v0.9.0 — *“Legendary Badges”* (September 4, 2025)

### 🏆 Legendary Badge & Completion Overhaul

* **Legend badge**: auto-awards once **all non-legend badges** are unlocked (95%), adds the final **+5%** for 100% completion.
* **Completion percent**: now **badge-driven only** → 95% from non-legend badge progress + 5% from the Legend badge.
* **XP caps** (Story 800, Camping 1000, QS 500, Infinity 1000, Extra 1700) remain in place for **levels & score pacing**, but no longer affect the completion bar.

---

### 🎖️ Badge System — Phase 2

* **Ant streak badge**: corrected ID → `kids_ants_streak10`; now fires properly when margin ≥10.
* **Grampy P**: still awarded on first chat send in Math Tips Village.
* **Play Music**: tied to first manual jukebox ▶️ press (not auto-play).
* **Change Theme**: awarded on first non-default theme (MobX reaction).
* **Tour**: awarded after sampling all major modes (QS, Infinity, Kids, Story, MathTips).
* **Kids Camping set** (all event-backed, one-shot):

  * `kids_cars_speed`: park all cars ≤60s (`kcParkingComplete`).
  * `kids_camp_10k`: Camping Score ≥10,000 (reaction on `popCount`).
  * `kids_mosquito`: first mosquito swat.
  * `kids_ants_streak10`: ant streak margin ≥10.
  * `kids_tents_all`: all tents lit (`kc:tents-all`).

---

### 🛠️ Stability & Cleanup

* **Unified completion percent** across Math Tips, profile tab, and Grampy P → all call `appState.getCompletionPercent()`.
* **Parking mini-game**: celebration flow fixed; `finalElapsedMs` frozen correctly; dispatch of `kcParkingComplete` stable.
* **Event unwiring**: Kids mode disposers guaranteed on exit; no dangling listeners.
* **Autosave**: badges and progress persist cleanly via MobX autorun.

---

### 🧪 QA Checklist (Legendary Pass)

* Unlock all non-legend badges → completion shows **95%**.
* After Legend auto-awards → completion shows **100%**.
* Ant streak ≥10 margin → `kids_ants_streak10` unlocks once.
* Verify persistence: reload after unlocking → badges remain unlocked.

---

### 📌 Dev Notes

> *“Completion is now pure badge-alchemy. 95% comes from the grind, 5% from the crown. XP still keeps the vibes flowing for levels, but the bar belongs to the badges. Ant Nemesis now fires true, and the Legend unlock finally feels earned.”*

---

### ⭐ Next

* Wire **Infinity** & **QuickServe** milestone badges (end-of-run triggers).
* Add **confetti/banner polish** for badge unlocks (rate-limited).
* Begin polish passes for MathTips Village (v0.9.1).


___



## v0.8.8 — *“The Grampy P Badge”* (August 30, 2025)

### 🎖️ Badges — Phase 1 (Event-Driven & One-Shot)

* **Grampy P**: awarded on the **first chat send** in Math Tips Village (`talk_grampy`).
* **Play Music**: awarded **only** when the **Jukebox ▶️ button** successfully starts playback the first time (`play_music`). (Not tied to auto-play or track-select.)
* **Change Theme**: awarded on the **first non-default theme** selection (`change_theme`) via a MobX reaction.
* **Try Modes**: lightweight “first visit” unlocks when entering a mode for the first time (per-mode ids like `try_qs`, `try_infinity`, `try_kids`, `try_story`, `try_mathtips`).
* **Kids Camping set** (all event-backed, idempotent):

  * `kids_cars_speed`: all cars parked **≤ 60s** (emits `kcParkingComplete` with `elapsedMs`).
  * `kids_camp_10k`: Camping Score **≥ 10,000** (MobX reaction on `appState.popCount`).
  * `kids_mosquito`: first mosquito swat (`onSwat()` callback).
  * `kids_ants_streak10`: red-ant win streak **≥ 10** (`kcAntStreak` event).
  * `kids_tents_all`: all tents lit (`kcTentsAllLit` event).

> Implementation notes: awards now happen **inside game/UI events**, not at module top level. Every badge check is guarded so it can’t double-award or throw on undefined vars.

---

### 🎧 Jukebox UX (Play/Pause Now Snappy)

* **Immediate button flip** on first Play: the ▶️ → ⏸️ label updates **right away**, then re-syncs on Howler `play/pause` events.
* “Now Playing” label updates reliably on play/pause/skip.
* Badge hook lives **in the Jukebox Play handler** and fires only on the first successful play.

---

### 🅿️ Parking Mini-Game Integration

* Fixed `initParkingGame` **named export** and wiring from `kidsCamping.js`.
* Parking emits **`kcParkingComplete`** with `{ elapsedMs }`; Kids mode listens and awards `kids_cars_speed` when `elapsedMs ≤ 60000`.

---

### 🛡️ Stability & Cleanup

* Removed stray, top-level `awardBadge(...)` calls that referenced **undefined** values (`count`, `seconds`, etc.).
* Centralized ambient unlocks in a tiny **achievements watcher**; disposers run on mode exit/HMR.
* Kids mode: all badge listeners are scoped to the Kids canvas and unwired on teardown.

---

### 🧪 QA Checklist (fast pass)

* **Math Tips**: send one message → “Grampy P” badge appears once.
* **Jukebox**: press ▶️ once → playback starts, button flips to ⏸️, “Play Music” badge appears. (Track-select alone should **not** award.)
* **Themes**: switch off default once → “Change Theme” badge.
* **Modes**: entering each mode once → “Try \*” badge for that mode.
* **Kids**:

  * Park all cars in < 60s → `kids_cars_speed`.
  * Reach 10,000 Camping Score (any mix) → `kids_camp_10k`.
  * Swat a mosquito once → `kids_mosquito`.
  * Hit ant streak 10 → `kids_ants_streak10`.
  * Light all tents → `kids_tents_all`.

---

### 📌 Dev Notes

> *“Badges were noisy; now they’re musical. Everything unlocks from real events, exactly once, and never at import time. The Jukebox play hook finally feels right — and yes, the button flips on the very first click.”*

---

### ⭐ Next

* End-of-run milestone badges for **Infinity** & **QuickServe** (score, streak, time buckets).
* Optional **confetti/banner** per unlock with rate-limit.

* ✅ **Prologue complete** — narrative flow locked in, typewriter intro, clean Prev/Next navigation.  
* ✅ **Chapter menu polish** — centered vertically, bigger “Story Mode Forest” title, buttons tidy + responsive.  
* ✅ **Legend portraits** — Galileo, Newton, Bram, Ada, Gauss, Jehnk all wired in; new `.sm-slide-legend` scaling system makes them shine.  
* ✅ **Spacing fixes** — title→image padding, bottom margins, and no underlapping text.  

### 🖼️ Art Integration

* Cosmic festival portraits generated + dropped in:  
  * Galileo night sky 🌌  
  * Newton’s force-laden ballet 🪐⚙️  
  * Ada storm spiral ⚡🎶  
  * Gauss tracing rain-arcs 🌧️➗  
  * Jehnk 2-Cones 🍧🍧 (tie-dye, sunnies)  
* Transparent-edge festival art for surreal storm moments — fades clean into the void.  
* Bram asset re-exported at 2× resolution — no more blur on retina.  

### 🧩 Practice Slides

---

### 📌 Dev Notes  

> *“Story Mode breathes now. Galileo whispers, Newton counters, Ada storms, Gauss arcs — and Jehnk hands out cones like wisdom. Phone looks good. Desktop scaling’s the last puzzle before v0.8.0. The forest is alive.”*  

---

## v0.7.0 — *“Bugs Swatted, Snacks Won.”* (August 8, 2025)

### 🏕️ Kids Camping — Mode Complete

* ✅ **Three (and mosquito) mini-games live & linked**: Tent Lines, Parking, Ant Attack — unified UI, shared score, clean transitions.
* ✅ **Mosquito mini-game added** — drifts into the play area, tap to splat, exact-touch splat graphic, +50 Camping Score.

### 🚗 Parking Game — Final Polish

* Smooth, festival-pace **drive-offs** (move holder, not img; eased; longer travel off-screen).
* All **11 cars** with ordinal flow; **+50** for correct order; **+100** if all parked **< 1 minute**.
* **Honk engine v2**: sequential `honk1–honk5`, progress remembered per car, victory honk on park.
* **Sprite preloader** eliminates first-load stutter; intro lane drive-by cancels on first input.

### 🐜 Ant Attack — Count Wins

* Pure **count-based tug-of-war**: food moves when weight met; **player wins ties**; direction can flip mid-pull.
* Every round ends with a score; **no ghost rounds**; late AI spawns cleared on round end.
* Weight overlay & “big snowcone” visual polish; UI synced with score updates.

### ⛺ Tent Lines — Resilient Glow

* Scoped SVG overlay per grid; retry & filter refresh for GPU hiccups; **solid-stroke fallback** if effects fail.
* “Solve-all” path awards **+100** and regenerates; mobile scaling & layout locks tightened.

### 🦟 Mosquito — Scoped, Chill, and Killable

* **Spawns every \~7s** (initial + respawn), gentle drift with bounce-bounds inside the **Kids canvas only**.
* **30% SFX volume** on `mosquito.mp3`, respects global mute; AudioContext unlock on first touch/click.

### 🧠 Scoring & XP

* Camping Score unified across minigames.
* **+100 XP per 1000 Camping Score** (MobX reaction; batches safely; no double awards).
* Score pop animation and HUD kept stable on small viewports.

### 🔊 Audio & Controls

---

### 📌 Dev Notes

> *“Kids Mode finally feels like a campsite: cars cruise in, ants brawl over snacks, and that mosquito learns respect. Clean loops, no leaks, tight scaling, buttery exits. Ship it.”*

## v0.6.6 — *“Tents Up, Cars Parked!”* (August 2, 2025)

### 🏕️ Kids Camping Parking Game — Complete

* ✅ **Full gameplay loop implemented and polished** — from "Park the Cars!" intro to full 11-car celebration.
* ✅ **PNG car sprites scale perfectly** — center-aligned, with honk label on the left and Park button on the right.
* ✅ **Honk Counter & UI**:

  * Responsive stacked layout — displays `X / Y` honks and ordinal parking order ("Park 3rd")
  * Prevents over-honking — no longer awards extra points after limit
* ✅ **Final overlay (“All Parked!”)**:

  * Holds visibly for 2.5s, then resets the game cleanly
  * Confetti and fade logic handled via manual overlay animation stack
  * Honk label and park button are hidden during this sequence

### 🧠 Scoring + XP Logic

* +1 pt per Park button press
* +10 pts for completing a car (regardless of order)
* +50 pts for correct ordinal match
* +100 pts if all cars parked in under one minute
* ✅ **XP batches**: +20 XP for every 100 points
* ✅ **Points now match visual feedback and game loop**

### 🔊 Honk Audio Engine (New!)

* 🔊 **Sequential SFX plays as cars require more honks:**

  * `honk1.mp3`, `honk2.mp3`, `...` up to `honk5.mp3`
  * Pattern loops after 5: 1 → 12 → 123 → 1234 → 12345 → 123451 → ...
* ✅ SFX progress is stored per car — returns to correct spot if user revisits car mid-sequence
* ✅ **Victory honk (honk1.mp3)** plays after successful parking

## v0.4.1 — “Stacking Scoops and Spooked Cats” (June 21, 2025)

### 🚨 Major Fixes
- Fixed critical z-index issue where Math Tips mode rendered *beneath* its background image.
- Updated `.game-frame`, `.mt-grid`, and `#modeBackground` hierarchy to enforce proper stacking.
- Backgrounds now consistently use `z-index: 1`, with mode UI layers at `z-index: 2` and `position: relative`.

### 🧠 Math Tips Mode Enhancements
- Created dedicated `.mt-grid` layout, separating it cleanly from `.qs-grid`.
- Scoped all Math Tips CSS to avoid bleed from other modes.
- Implemented scrollable `.chatbox` with height cap and internal layout stability.
- Refactored Pythagoras Cat chat logic with thematic responses and clear visual formatting.

### 🧪 Experimental Discoveries
- Confirmed that `img.src = img.src` helps repaint on mobile but does not fix layer order.
- Discovered shared grid styles between modes can cause fatal visual bugs — all modes now require isolated grid class names.
- General CSS styles can unintentionally override mode-specific layout unless scoped.

### 📌 Dev Notes
> "The cat was behind the curtain, the grid wasn’t real, and the background laughed at your assumptions. But now it works. You earned this one."


## v0.3.0 – Transition System & Startup Screen (June 21, 2025)

### 🌠 New Startup Experience

* Added **startup screen sequence**:
  * Starfield background fades in
  * SnowCone PNG fades in slightly above center
  * Entire screen fades out, revealing main menu
  * Coordinated timing for a smooth, welcoming vibe

### 🌀 Scene Transition System Finalized

* Built full `playTransition()` animation:
  * Truck drives across top → Cone slides across bottom
  * Overlays starfield during transition
  * Delays mode entry until animations complete
* Used consistently across all mode labels and return buttons
* Modes supported: `kids`, `quickServe`, `mathtips`, `story`, `infinity`

### 🎯 Refactors & Bug Fixes

* Switched menu label click handlers to use `playTransition()`
* Corrected "mathTips" to lowercase "mathtips" for sceneManager routing
* Modularized `setupMenu()` logic for cleaner flow
* Fixed info modal bug where clicking title PNG opened the cosmic modal incorrectly
* Ensured `menu-wrapper` visibility state resets on transition completion

### 🎨 Visual Polish

* Re-centered SnowCone PNG vertically in startup screen
* Slight speed-up in transition + startup animations for better pacing
* Verified main menu alignment still stable on desktop
* Info Modal and Cosmic Modal no longer overlap or misfire

### 🚀 Coming Up

* Mobile validation for startup + transitions
* Build out actual content in QuickServe and other modes

---

## v0.2.5 – Dev Log Update (June 15, 2025)

### 🌀 Transition Experiments

* Built `transitionManager.js` to control scene fades
  * Included `fadeIn`, `fadeOut`, and `transitionToHTML` utilities
  * Used `requestAnimationFrame` and class-based transitions
* Attempted smooth fade between menu and game modes
* Encountered persistent issues:
  * Game container fading to blank
  * Background PNG flashing briefly, then disappearing
  * Mode content failing to mount in time for visibility
* After deep debugging, **removed all fades** and reverted to instant transitions
* Plan to revisit transitions later with `GSAP` and cone-split animation

### 🍧 QuickServe Mode Launches

* Built fully self-contained **QuickServe scene**
  * Injected PNG background into `.game-frame`
  * Used `.qs-grid` layout with header, content, footer
  * PNG now vertically centered and matched to grid proportions
* `game-container` now overlays properly with `z-index: 2`
* Grid system matches vertical alignment goals, not stretched horizontally

### ✅ Refactors + Fixes

* Removed broken fade logic from QuickServe
* Simplified background image application per-mode
* Confirmed QuickServe works with manual background PNG injection
* Confirmed `return to menu` fully restores main view

### 🎯 Dev Learnings

* Background PNGs should be **injected per mode** unless there's a solid reason to manage globally
* Scene transitions are better **handled separately** from content injection
* Grid overlay matched to PNG is viable with careful CSS planning
* Sometimes instant swap is better than subtle fade (for now)

### 📦 Folder Thoughts

* `fadeIn` and `fadeOut` likely not needed in current form
* `transitionManager.js` kept for future GSAP-powered transitions
* All assets for QuickServe kept scoped under `/modes/quickServe/`

---

## v0.2.0 – Modal Polish & Return of QuickServe (June 1–14, 2025)

* Created basic mode switching logic using `sceneManager.js`

---

## v0.1.5 – Main Menu + Cosmic Modal Begins (May 14–16, 2025)

### 🧊 Main Menu Overhaul

* Locked in label positions using `CSS Grid`
* Added glowing ethereal label styling

### 🛸 Cosmic Modal V1

* Introduced modal system with tabs: Profile, Music, Themes, Version
* Used `clamp()` + responsive sizing for all modal content
* First use of persistent save settings with CDMS (localStorage wrapper)

---

## v0.1.0 – Project Reboot & Clean Slate (May 12, 2025)

### 🎯 Core Direction Set

* Reset SnowCone MathFest project from scratch
* Switched to **Vite** for blazing-fast builds and modular structure
* Established new folder structure:
  * `/src` for all app logic
  * `/public` for assets
* Decided on vertical-fit backgrounds for all scenes
* CSS Grid selected as the layout anchor for the entire app
