## v0.2.5 – Dev Log Update (June 15, 2025)

### 🌀 Transition Experiments

* Built `transitionManager.js` to control scene fades

  * Included `fadeIn`, `fadeOut`, and `transitionToHTML` utilities
  * Used `requestAnimationFrame` and class-based transitions
* Attempted smooth fade between menu and game modes
* Encountered persistent issues:

  * Game container fading to blank
  * Background PNG flashing briefly, then disappearing
  * Mode content failing to mount in time for visibility
* After deep debugging, **removed all fades** and reverted to instant transitions
* Plan to revisit transitions later with `GSAP` and cone-split animation

### 🍧 QuickServe Mode Launches

* Built fully self-contained **QuickServe scene**

  * Injected PNG background into `.game-frame`
  * Used `.qs-grid` layout with header, content, footer
  * PNG now vertically centered and matched to grid proportions
* `game-container` now overlays properly with `z-index: 2`
* Grid system matches vertical alignment goals, not stretched horizontally

### ✅ Refactors + Fixes

* Removed broken fade logic from QuickServe
* Simplified background image application per-mode
* Confirmed QuickServe works with manual background PNG injection
* Confirmed `return to menu` fully restores main view

### 🎯 Dev Learnings

* Background PNGs should be **injected per mode** unless there's a solid reason to manage globally
* Scene transitions are better **handled separately** from content injection
* Grid overlay matched to PNG is viable with careful CSS planning
* Sometimes instant swap is better than subtle fade (for now)

### 📦 Folder Thoughts

* `fadeIn` and `fadeOut` likely not needed in current form
* `transitionManager.js` kept for future GSAP-powered transitions
* All assets for QuickServe kept scoped under `/modes/quickServe/`

Next up:

* Rebuild "split-cone" animation using GSAP
* Add unlock animations for badge completion
* Integrate XP & feedback UI into QuickServe mode
* Evaluate whether to inject future mode UIs via `sceneManager` or keep local
* Continue prepping `v0.3.0` milestone 🚀
