## v0.6.6 — *“Tents Up, Cars Parked!”* (August 2, 2025)

### 🏕️ Kids Camping Parking Game — Complete

* ✅ **Full gameplay loop implemented and polished** — from "Park the Cars!" intro to full 11-car celebration.
* ✅ **PNG car sprites scale perfectly** — center-aligned, with honk label on the left and Park button on the right.
* ✅ **Honk Counter & UI**:

  * Responsive stacked layout — displays `X / Y` honks and ordinal parking order ("Park 3rd")
  * Prevents over-honking — no longer awards extra points after limit
* ✅ **Final overlay (“All Parked!”)**:

  * Holds visibly for 2.5s, then resets the game cleanly
  * Confetti and fade logic handled via manual overlay animation stack
  * Honk label and park button are hidden during this sequence

### 🧠 Scoring + XP Logic

* +1 pt per Park button press
* +10 pts for completing a car (regardless of order)
* +50 pts for correct ordinal match
* +100 pts if all cars parked in under one minute
* ✅ **XP batches**: +20 XP for every 100 points
* ✅ **Points now match visual feedback and game loop**

### 🔊 Honk Audio Engine (New!)

* 🔊 **Sequential SFX plays as cars require more honks:**

  * `honk1.mp3`, `honk2.mp3`, `...` up to `honk5.mp3`
  * Pattern loops after 5: 1 → 12 → 123 → 1234 → 12345 → 123451 → ...
* ✅ SFX progress is stored per car — returns to correct spot if user revisits car mid-sequence
* ✅ **Victory honk (honk1.mp3)** plays after successful parking
* 🔇 Fully respects global mute toggle (`Howler` synced)

### 📦 Asset & Layout Enhancements

* 🖼️ All car PNGs preloaded on game init via `preloadParkingSprites()`
* 🎨 Fixed snapping and layout jumping between car transitions
* 🔍 Added padding and alignment fixes for consistent vertical locking on mobile and desktop
* ✅ Fade/transition stacking logic cleanly scopes overlay events (no stuck honk or park buttons)

### 📱 Mobile Polish

* ✅ Touch-friendly Park button scaling
* ✅ Car press + park button responsiveness tweaked for fast tapping
* ✅ Smaller viewports no longer push car below screen or snap layout
* ✅ Double-tap zoom prevention applied to parking zone

---

### 📌 Dev Notes

> *“It actually works. The game is responsive, musical, and smooth — and yeah, you gotta honk 66 times if you want that final car parked. But it’s worth it. Preloading, scaling, hiding, scoring, syncing... it all paid off. This is what done feels like.”*

## v0.4.1 — “Stacking Scoops and Spooked Cats” (June 21, 2025)

### 🚨 Major Fixes
- Fixed critical z-index issue where Math Tips mode rendered *beneath* its background image.
- Updated `.game-frame`, `.mt-grid`, and `#modeBackground` hierarchy to enforce proper stacking.
- Backgrounds now consistently use `z-index: 1`, with mode UI layers at `z-index: 2` and `position: relative`.

### 🧠 Math Tips Mode Enhancements
- Created dedicated `.mt-grid` layout, separating it cleanly from `.qs-grid`.
- Scoped all Math Tips CSS to avoid bleed from other modes.
- Implemented scrollable `.chatbox` with height cap and internal layout stability.
- Refactored Pythagoras Cat chat logic with thematic responses and clear visual formatting.

### 🧪 Experimental Discoveries
- Confirmed that `img.src = img.src` helps repaint on mobile but does not fix layer order.
- Discovered shared grid styles between modes can cause fatal visual bugs — all modes now require isolated grid class names.
- General CSS styles can unintentionally override mode-specific layout unless scoped.

### 📌 Dev Notes
> "The cat was behind the curtain, the grid wasn’t real, and the background laughed at your assumptions. But now it works. You earned this one."


## v0.3.0 – Transition System & Startup Screen (June 21, 2025)

### 🌠 New Startup Experience

* Added **startup screen sequence**:
  * Starfield background fades in
  * SnowCone PNG fades in slightly above center
  * Entire screen fades out, revealing main menu
  * Coordinated timing for a smooth, welcoming vibe

### 🌀 Scene Transition System Finalized

* Built full `playTransition()` animation:
  * Truck drives across top → Cone slides across bottom
  * Overlays starfield during transition
  * Delays mode entry until animations complete
* Used consistently across all mode labels and return buttons
* Modes supported: `kids`, `quickServe`, `mathtips`, `story`, `infinity`

### 🎯 Refactors & Bug Fixes

* Switched menu label click handlers to use `playTransition()`
* Corrected "mathTips" to lowercase "mathtips" for sceneManager routing
* Modularized `setupMenu()` logic for cleaner flow
* Fixed info modal bug where clicking title PNG opened the cosmic modal incorrectly
* Ensured `menu-wrapper` visibility state resets on transition completion

### 🎨 Visual Polish

* Re-centered SnowCone PNG vertically in startup screen
* Slight speed-up in transition + startup animations for better pacing
* Verified main menu alignment still stable on desktop
* Info Modal and Cosmic Modal no longer overlap or misfire

### 🚀 Coming Up

* Mobile validation for startup + transitions
* Build out actual content in QuickServe and other modes

---

## v0.2.5 – Dev Log Update (June 15, 2025)

### 🌀 Transition Experiments

* Built `transitionManager.js` to control scene fades
  * Included `fadeIn`, `fadeOut`, and `transitionToHTML` utilities
  * Used `requestAnimationFrame` and class-based transitions
* Attempted smooth fade between menu and game modes
* Encountered persistent issues:
  * Game container fading to blank
  * Background PNG flashing briefly, then disappearing
  * Mode content failing to mount in time for visibility
* After deep debugging, **removed all fades** and reverted to instant transitions
* Plan to revisit transitions later with `GSAP` and cone-split animation

### 🍧 QuickServe Mode Launches

* Built fully self-contained **QuickServe scene**
  * Injected PNG background into `.game-frame`
  * Used `.qs-grid` layout with header, content, footer
  * PNG now vertically centered and matched to grid proportions
* `game-container` now overlays properly with `z-index: 2`
* Grid system matches vertical alignment goals, not stretched horizontally

### ✅ Refactors + Fixes

* Removed broken fade logic from QuickServe
* Simplified background image application per-mode
* Confirmed QuickServe works with manual background PNG injection
* Confirmed `return to menu` fully restores main view

### 🎯 Dev Learnings

* Background PNGs should be **injected per mode** unless there's a solid reason to manage globally
* Scene transitions are better **handled separately** from content injection
* Grid overlay matched to PNG is viable with careful CSS planning
* Sometimes instant swap is better than subtle fade (for now)

### 📦 Folder Thoughts

* `fadeIn` and `fadeOut` likely not needed in current form
* `transitionManager.js` kept for future GSAP-powered transitions
* All assets for QuickServe kept scoped under `/modes/quickServe/`

---

## v0.2.0 – Modal Polish & Return of QuickServe (June 1–14, 2025)

### 🎛️ Modal Enhancements

* Rewired modal tab switching dynamically

### 🍧 QuickServe Returns

* Injected PNG background for QuickServe
* Aligned layout with `.qs-grid`
* Created basic mode switching logic using `sceneManager.js`

---

## v0.1.5 – Main Menu + Cosmic Modal Begins (May 14–16, 2025)

### 🧊 Main Menu Overhaul

* Implemented full-screen background PNG scaling
* Locked in label positions using `CSS Grid`
* Added glowing ethereal label styling

### 🛸 Cosmic Modal V1

* Introduced modal system with tabs: Profile, Music, Themes, Version
* Used `clamp()` + responsive sizing for all modal content
* First use of persistent save settings with CDMS (localStorage wrapper)

---

## v0.1.0 – Project Reboot & Clean Slate (May 12, 2025)

### 🎯 Core Direction Set

* Reset SnowCone MathFest project from scratch
* Switched to **Vite** for blazing-fast builds and modular structure
* Established new folder structure:
  * `/src` for all app logic
  * `/public` for assets
* Decided on vertical-fit backgrounds for all scenes
* CSS Grid selected as the layout anchor for the entire app
